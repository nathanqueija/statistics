    "An outlier is an observation or a value, in this case is a grade, that lies an abnormal distance from other values. It means that even though this student performed very well, one outlier dragged the average grade down and I think it's not fair in this case. The same would happen for a student that haven't performed the whole year, but for some reason get good results in the final exams. Should we consider that this student is a dedicated one?\n",

    "In this case if we're measuring the performance of a student for the year I think the median represents better the whole data.\n",

    "\n",
    "### When to consider outliers in your analysis?\n",
    "It depends on your goal and what conclusion you want to derive from the data. You can ask yourself if in a given situation considering outliers is important or not. Let's say that this school wants to run an experiment to find anomalies in the students grades, for example, to find students that for some reason stopped performing in a consistent way. Maybe considering the outliers would be beneficial to reach the conclusions in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "To sum up, don't add or remove outliers (or use the mean or median) without thinking about what is your goal. Understand your data. Your data has different ways to tell you stories, it's up to you to understand which story is more important to you in a given situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "And oh, the teachers realised that something happened with the student and gave him a chance to do the test again. His score was `10`. All good in Statsland!\n",
