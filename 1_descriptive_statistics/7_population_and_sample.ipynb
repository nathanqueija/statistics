    "Imagine that you're analysing the grades for a statistics class of 40 students. The population would be all the 40 students grades and the sample would be a slice of this population, e.g., 12, 40, 34, etc. The sample is representative of the population.\n",
    "Usually when we're working with samples we're always refering to measures of estimates from the population, i. e., we can calculate the mean, standard deviation, etc. of a sample infering that the value for the population would or should be close to the sample value.\n",
    "The basic idea around this distinction is that you'd use the sample to generalise and make assumptions about the population data.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Should I use the population data or select a sample from the population?\n",
    "\n",
    "It depends. If the population size is not huge, or it's possible to have data for the whole population then the population data can be used. For example, the number os students in a specific class, the salaries of employees in the tech department of a specific company, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the population size is too big or can't be collected completely then we have to use a sample from it, for example, the average salary or men and women in the last year. Can you collect the data of every single man and woman in the world to calculate the mean? No, that would be too expensive and even if you could the computacional processing you'd need to make operations in this huge dataset would be enormous. It's not really feasible.\n",
